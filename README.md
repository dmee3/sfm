This is a simple file manager I'm writing as a project to learn Rust. Right now all it does is basic directory navigation. More to come soon!

## Controls
```
up/down:      Move to previous/next entry in the directory (hold shift to move 10 items at a time)
left/right:   Move up/down a directory
enter:        Move down a directory, or <TODO: open file>
q/esc:        Quit
```
