This is a simple file manager I'm writing as a project to learn Rust. Right now all it does is basic directory navigation. More to come soon!

## Controls
```
up/down:      Select previous/next entry in the directory
left/right:   Move up/down a directory
q:            Quit
```

### TODO
- Sort directory entries
- Support scrolling for directories containing more than <termion::terminal_size> lines
- Preview files
- Open files with vim
